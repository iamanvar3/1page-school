      <h1>📘 Build Strong Habits</h1>
      <p>Want to change your life? Start small and stay consistent.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pick One Tiny Habit:</strong> Choose a habit so small it feels effortless—like 1 push-up or 1 line of writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Anchor It:</strong> Attach your new habit to something you already do (e.g., after brushing your teeth).</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Easy:</strong> Prepare your environment to remove friction. Simplicity wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate It:</strong> Smile, fist pump, or say “I’m becoming better!” after every success. Reinforce the habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Use a simple calendar or app. Small streaks build big momentum.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Forgiving:</strong> Missed a day? No guilt. Restart immediately. Consistency, not perfection.</li>
