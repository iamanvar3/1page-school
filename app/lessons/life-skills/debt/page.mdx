# 💳 How to Manage Your Debt

- 📊 **Track** all your debts and interest rates.  
- 💸 **Pay** at least the minimum on all, but focus extra payments on the highest-interest debt first (the avalanche method).  
- 🚫 **Avoid** new debt unless absolutely necessary.  
- 🛟 **Build** an emergency fund to avoid future borrowing.  
- 🤝 **Seek help** if overwhelmed — nonprofit credit counseling is available.
