      <p>
        1. Teach what you learn to others<br />
        2. Use spaced repetition (review over days/weeks)<br />
        3. Take notes by hand in your own words<br />
        4. Learn in short focused bursts (no multitasking)<br />
        5. Sleep well â€“ it's when your brain locks in knowledge<br />
        <br />
        Learn how to learn â€” it's a superpower for life.
